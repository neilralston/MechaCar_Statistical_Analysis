## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

   As illustrated in the table below, both the vehicle length and ground clearance variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?



3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
