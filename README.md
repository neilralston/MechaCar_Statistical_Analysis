## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

   As illustrated in the table below, both the vehicle length and ground clearance variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
   
   The vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg values. Less so but perhaps still significant is the vehicle

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

   The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is less than an assumed significance level of 0.05%. 
   
   Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

   Yes, this linear model is an efficient predicotr of mpg based on the following results:
   
   * p-value is < assumed significance level of 0.05%, suggesting significant variable impacts
   * Multiple r-squared value is > 0.70, suggesting strong correlation
