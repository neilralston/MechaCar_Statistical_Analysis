## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

   As illustrated in the table below, both the vehicle length and ground clearance variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
   
   The vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg values.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

   The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is less than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. 
   
   Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
